# Frequent Generalized Subgraph Mining
## About this repository
The code in this repository can be used to mine the frequent generalized subgraphs in a graph
database of undirected labeled graphs.

## Installation
Installation instructions for Linux systems. This repo has only been tested on Ubuntu Linux. To compile all requirements and the source, Python 3, Cmake, Make, and a C++ compiler with support for C++14 are required.

### Install Gurobi
First, install Gurobi. To help with the installation, we list the necessary steps here:

1. Download Gurobi from https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-software/
2. Extract the downloaded file, for example into your $HOME directory
3. Save the following lines into your .bashrc  
`export GUROBI_HOME="${HOME}/gurobi951/linux64"`  
`export PATH="${PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/bin"`  
`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/lib"`  
`export GRB_LICENSE_FILE="${HOME}/gurobi951/gurobi.lic"`  
4. Register at gurobi.com and get your free academic license
5. Log in and visit https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/licenses/
6. Copy-paste the grbgetkey command into a terminal and hit enter.  
grbgetkey will ask where to store the license key. Make sure to store the license key in `$HOME/gurobi951/gurobi.lic`
7. In a terminal, navigate to `$HOME/gurobi951/linux64/src/build` and write the following command:  
`make`
8. Copy `libgurobi_c++.a` into the following folder: `$HOME/gurobi951/linux64/lib`

### Install Gedlib
1. `cd external/gedlib`
2. `python3 install.py --gurobi ~/gurobi951/linux64 --lib mytypes,size_t,int,int`

Note: Make sure that external/gedlib/src/CMakelists.txt does not add the
mtypesgedlib library before the commands above have been executed.

### Install this Repo

`mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build . -j32`  

After executing this command, the executables can be found in the build directory

### Possible errors
If `cmake --build .` gives `fatal error: gurobi_c++.h: No such file or directory`,
then: `source ~/.bashrc && cmake .. && cmake --build .` may fix it.

## Using this repo
This repository can be used to mine the frequent generalized subgraphs in a graph
database of undirected labeled graphs by making use of graph edit distances.
The graphs in the database can have vertex and/or edge
labels. The mining process uses a taxonomy on the vertex labels.
For more information about this method, see

R. Palme, P. Welke: "Frequent Generalized Graph Mining via Graph Edit
Distances", under review at SeDaMiâ€™22 Workshop at ECML/PKDD.  

To read about the inner workings of the algorithm, see  

R. Palme: "Frequent Approximate Subgraph Mining with Polynomial Delay",
master's thesis.

The executable `generalized_FSM` is used to mine the freq. generalized subgraphs. Options for `generalized_FSM`:

`-dataset_name`: The name of a dataset of undirected graphs.
The user must create a directory `/data/dataset_name` in the
working directory, which must contain the graph database in TUDataset format. 

The TUDataset format ensures that the vertex are labeled with 0,1,2,...,k.
The user must make sure that the directory `/data/dataset_name` contains a
file of name `edit_costs.txt`, which contains a comma-separated Boolean matrix
C, with C[a,b] = 0 if and only if (a=b or b is
more general than a in the vertex label taxonomy). Here, a and b correspond to
vertex labels in {0,1,...,k}. In particular, C must have at least k+1 rows and columns.

`-max_size`: The maximum number of edges of a graph in the output.

`-exact_gi`: 1 if graph isomorphism shall be computed with an exact algorithm (using
Nauty), 0 if graph isomorphism shall be computed with a heuristic algorithm
(Weisfeiler-Leman).

`-ged_method`: 0 if graph edit distance shall be computed with an exact algorithm
(using Gurobi), 1-5 if graph edit distance shall be computed with a heuristic
algorithm (see also: GEDMethod defined in src/sged_gedlib.h)

`-num_new_labels`: The number of vertex labels that do appear in the taxonomy, but not
in the graph database. If the vertex labels in the graph database are
0,1,2,...,k, then the new vertex labels will be k+1,k+2,... (the label names
are important
for defining the cost matrix in `/data/dataset_name/edit_costs.txt`)

`-t`: relative frequency threshold for the graph mining. Must be an integer
between 1 and 100.

### Example
    generalized_FSM -dataset_name MUTAG -max_size 12 -exact_gi 1 -ged_method 0 -num_new_labels 3 -t 42
